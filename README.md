## **UFO Sightings**

### **Purpose**

UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) has been a source of curiosity since the dawn of modern civilisation. The project aims to develop a website that displays data stored in JS format where users can customise the data based on the choice of filters. 

### **Results**
- The default website gives an overview of what sort of data the website hold. The website navigation is self-explanatory, and the dark effect has been added to make the website easy on the eyes. The below image illustrates the default view of the website.

- The filters can be used to spot the UFO sighting based on the particular state, date, city, and even the shape of the UFO. For example, the image below shows the UFOs sighted in California.

### **Summary (Limitations and Improvements)**

The filters are easy to use, and one can clear the filter by removing the added criteria. Although below are limited when it comes to the useability of the website:

- The filters are only appearing when clicking outside the entry box. In practice, this might lead to users clicking in other URLs or functions that may direct him/her to a different part of the website. The 'Apply filters' button would have been helpful to avoid such circumstances.
- Also, the process of clearing filters is not fully streamlined. A 'Clear filters' button would be helpful to keep in such websites.
- Finally, the case filters can be made 'Case insensitive' to make it more user friendly.
